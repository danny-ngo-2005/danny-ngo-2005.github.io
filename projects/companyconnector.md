Project Janus is a final project developed by the members of me, Royce, Ethan, and Isaiah. Our website is a company connector which allows users to search up any opportunities that a company offers. This website allows for you to sign up an account whether it be student or company.

You are able to customize your profile of your own accord, and if you chose a company account, you are able to formulate opportunities if other students are interested. This project has given an opportunity for me to not only enhance my programming skills when it came to developing

different pages, but it also gave me the opportunity to understand and teach myself more about databases and how I can implement it into websites. Not only was I able to develop my coding skills, but I also was able to develop my social skills when it came to collaborating with

team members. I had to ensure a leadership role in order to get out website running, and so that our team members were up to date on what components they were working on.
