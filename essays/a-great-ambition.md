## Expectations Perceived by Me

Going into software engineering, I was nervous about what the contents of the class was going to be about. A lot of the anxious ideas I had in mind was the amount of arithmetic and logic calculations that I had to understand and study before even starting the class. However, the idea of opportunities was also a branch that I'd also like to explore as well. By giving myself time and practice to reach those oportunities, I am able to perform countless abilities that I never knew I could ever do. 

## Opportunities everywhere

When entering the class, one goal that I was always interested in ever since I was in middle school was to be able to create my own website. Not only was it a place where anyone can acknowledge the work and achievements I made, but it also made me feel like I was able to direct my own future through my website. I even think of the website as my autobiography: a place where history is made.

Another goal I had in mind was to improve my collaboration with other peers. While this may be a universal goal to many, I feel that this is crucial for me as well, especially since it comes to writing code together. My hopes are that I am able to communicate my input with other collaboraters, and put my piece into the conversation. 

## In short...

Opportunities glisters like stars, but they are a challenge to reach. To even reach such a place, I'd have to allocate my resources and time. At the end of the journey, however, the view can be amazing.
