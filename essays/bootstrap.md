## Web Designing in General...
If you were to look up web designs from its early development, such as during its late 1900s, you would find many colorful and unique websites created by many curious users who saw the web as a new toolbox to tinker with. In fact, if it were not for such risky takes made by the user of the world wide web, we would not even have Google or Facebook! When compared to modern day web design, however, it is not as exciting and unique as it was back when it was first originated. Now, creating a website would not even require coding at all, as there are other websites that create websites for you with much convenience. However, such convenience could limit your ability to perform the most beautiful aspects of the World Wide Web. Though, in order to even display a website that shines your personality, you must also learn its aspects of coding. Coding that may make or break your dreams, depending on how determined you are to learn everything that there is to learn about web design.

## Coding vs. Formatting
What makes UI Frameworks such a controversial aspect to learn when it comes to programming? At first glance, the structure of a UI Framework can be stored along with other programming languages. Though, once you start to tinker with UI Frameworks by coding a few lines of code, you'll soon find it to be frustrating. One of the main issues I found when it comes to coding UI Frameworks as opposed to coding with other programming language is the struggles of fixing your code. In most cases when it comes to other programming language, the mistake is often logically understood, and modifying the code can be simple as fixing a single character in the code. In most cases for UI Frameworks, small mistakes in the coding leads to countless trial-and-error, with the user having to fix other elements of the code. Such mistakes can come from wrong font to even spacing from row to row. In such a way, we can say that UI Frameworks would be the English section of Computer Science. It is similar to writing an essay in MLA format, except that the rules for MLA format is written like a royal scroll.

## Worth the Effort?
However, just like learning coding in general, you'll be able to unlock skills that you thought were never possible. Not only are you able to make your own website, but you are able to modify your website to your command. If dealing with errors are a big issue, or if you are not sure how you are able to get assets without the issue of learning digital art, there are other extensions and applications that can strongly aid in your web design abilities, such as BootStrap and Fonts Ninja. In fact, when using BootStrap, I was able to create many websites that you would assume would be from the Wix website. If I were to recommend any extension to a coder who is struggling or is new to web design, BootStrap would be the first thing that comes up in my mind.
