## A Pattern in Programming

One of the most impactful topics that I've gone to develop into my programming skills are design patterns. In fact, such design patterns are what allowed me to fix many common mistakes that I would otherwise take several minutes to fix when all it could take is a couple seconds.
I can see how design patterns in general can be utilized to help out in other aspects instead of programming. For example, many small mistakes such as forgetting something at your house can be fix by utilizing a tool to force you to remember, like a notification or a stick-it note. Same goes with how if you feel that there was an issue occuring medically, you would go to the hospital. Such is the way design patterns work in software engineering, and by taking the time to follow those design pattern, I am able to work much more efficiently and quickly.

## The Right to Program?

The ability and skill to program code is both a gift and curse. When it comes to coding for one, you are able to develop many applications, methods, tools, and even life-changing programs that can help someone go through life much more conveniently or for a group in general. For another, such skills can be used to cause harm to other. The ability to program comes the responsibility to maintain. Ethics doesn't just apply to programming, but it applies in daily life as well. A mistake you make such as crossing a red light or parking in an inappropriate spot may seem confusing and down right unecessary, but such rules were made based on the mistakes made because of those actions. Ethics is not just a topic to learn, but a lesson of caution and importance for the convenience of not just you, but of everyone else. A tool used to benefit everyone yields greater benefits.

## To Learn

As I approach the end of my learning for software engineering, I have soon come to realize the importance of taking such a class. The class isn't just taught on the different ways and tools used to develop applications, but also how you would communicate with others when developing programs and how you should expect to program in order for more efficiency and understanding from not just you, but from others who cooperate with you in your programming experience.
