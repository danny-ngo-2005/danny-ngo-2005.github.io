## A Force of Evil to Some
Artificial intelligience has always gone through a growing development. Such so that in just a couple years, pictures, videos, and even audio were fabricated through the technicalities of artificial intelligence. Though A.I itself is a puzzling wonder that marks the beginning
of a new developing research, a concern lies among much of the community about its ethical use. Because of these features, issues arises such as how it could be use for illegal intent, or how debates arises among work done with heartful intent behind it versus someone creating
work in just a few words.

## A Boon to the World
Yet, A.I. has shown to give much benefit, especially to those who are going through their educational phase in their lifetime. Because of the popularity of A.I., students are able to utilize this tool to aid them in studying. Not only can it be used as a tool to aid in education,
but it also has a capacity to aid in normal-day situations. A person's dilemna can be solved through just an input from their keyboards. Complicated topics can be turned into simple topics for the student to understand. Of course, relying on A.I. fully won't give the most efficient
results to a student's learning, but when handled appropriately can allow them to understand a topic without having to take too much time and effort.

## A Personal Buddy
In the world of programming, A.I. is used almost everywhere. Especially when it comes to small errors that occur in the program, an A.I. can be able to check through the program to ensure that fixes are met. Especially when it came to my time programming, A.I. has been a big help in
allowing me to fix small issues in the program that would otherwise take me 10 minutes. Though, to rely on A.I. would be too big of an issue for me, as I feel that nothing is to be learnt of if I gave the A.I. the work to program everything. Rather, it was better for me to integrate
the concepts of programming into my code and let A.I. handle any syntax errors. Though I limit myself a lot on the use of A.I. and speak about its issues in a global scale, I can't help but appreciate having an artificial buddy to help me out with my time coding.

To give a good idea of how I utilize A.I. in my time as a programmer:
  1. Experience WODs: I utilize A.I. when it came to experience WODs. I find that getting into first contact with different areas of computer science can be complex and in other times intimidating. However, the use of A.I. has allowed me to look up specific areas for which an issue would occur in my end, and act as a troubleshoot guide for me.
  2. In-class Practice WODs: Utilizing A.I. during practice WODs was not recommended, as the purpose of these WODs was to practice what I had learned from my homeworks and observe how long I was able to write code given a limited time. While using A.I. could have helped me with these WODs, I usually refrain from them in hopes to see how I would do during these WODs.
  3. In-Class WODs: These WODs were a half-half situation. Generally, as long as the concepts were understood, I did not have to utilize A.I. However, given circumstances such as modifying a large chunk of code in order to fix syntax errors, I would use A.I.
  4. Essays: I never use A.I. for any essays I wrote. I always wanted to write my essays according to my own words rather than through use of A.I. I feel it would give more life to the essays when people come to read them, such as this one!
  5. Learning a concept/tutorial: I utilize A.I. heavily on these, as the purpose of utilizing them is to either gain more understanding of the topics I would cover or give myself more challenge to tinker with.
  6. Final project: I do utilize A.I. when it came to the project, as it helped me get rid of any ESLint errors, especially when it came to trying to run my development in Vercel.
  7. Answering a question in Discord: I would not use A.I. when it came to answering a question in Discord, since I would assume that the other end has already utilized it. Also, it felt strange that the suggestions I make in Discord would come from A.I. rather than myself.
  8. Asking or answering a smart question in Discord: Similar to 7, I would refrain myself from using A.I, since I want to hear suggestions based off on classmates themself.
  9. Coding examples: I utilized A.I. when it came to coding examples mainly for practice and understanding the concept.
  10. Explaining code: I utilized A.I. as well when it comes to explanation of code, as it helps me understand a concept more thoroughly. I also use it to formulate other codes and see if I understood the concept by reading it off of another complex code.
  11. Writing code: The approach I take when it comes to writing code is to try it out first, then when you feel stuck, use A.I.
  12. Documenting code: I refrain from using A.I. when it comes to documenting code, as I want to be able to explain the code in my own words, and make it more simpler for other coders who are familiar with how I document my code.
  13. Quality Assurance: I use A.I. when it comes to quality assurance, as I want to make sure my code fits with the public standards.
  14. Other uses: I use A.I. in other fields usually when I'm interested in a topic and I want to see how A.I. interprets that topic. Most of the time I use A.I. to satiate my curiosity.

## A.I. vs. Authentic
There are many advantages when it comes to A.I. than opposed to a professor teaching you the concept. For one, any questions that you would have in your mind would be answered instantly and without any judgement, as A.I. is programmed to help you, and not having the afterthought of someone silently judging you based on the idea of the question being stupidly easy is satisfying. Another advantage is that any specific questions that you would have would be instantly solved as well, and you can even ask it to go into more detail about the topics in general. However, given the early development of A.I., one issue that arises when it comes to A.I. is its validity. Not every answer is valid, in that you may get an incorrect response. A professor will be able to teach you the concept because they themselves have practiced and given time and effort to understand the topic completely.

## In conclusion
With the coming era of A.I. there should also be a way for students to learn a subject more efficiently. In courses, A.I. could potentially be a guiding hand to a struggling student. However, while A.I. is showing signs of improvements, there should always be consideration for moderation. If a student wants to truly understand a topic much more knowledgebly, then they should also realize that it is best not to rely on them, but more so of as a last resort instead. The future is bright for A.I., but it is also bright for the students.
