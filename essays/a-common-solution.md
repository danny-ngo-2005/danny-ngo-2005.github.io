A common issue always occur to many programmers as they tinker with coding. Every problem generally has a solution to it, and while many other programmers may have trouble fixing such errors, others have probably already found the solution to the problem. The usage of design
patterns has been an critical benefit in programming, as it allows programmers to be able to solve different issues using common reusable solutions. The way to think of design patterns are like a toolbox. Each individual design patterns resemble the individual tools to utilize, and
every problem can resemble what the tools are used for.

As oppose to programming based on wits, a design pattern has their benefits for the programmer. Especially when it comes to projects and large teams, it is often recommended to write your program in a format similar to a design pattern, as it allows others to see common issues and
reuse components of design patterns.

## Design Patterns?

There are a wide variety of design patterns to consider. However, most of these design patterns for a programmer were probably unintentionally used. By giving more time to recognize these design patterns, a programmer can be also be able to reinforce their design patterns. 
I would like to list some design patterns that I found to be effective in my programming skills:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Prototype Method: This method involves a cut-and-paste approach which involves creating new instances from another pre-existing instance. This is an optimal choice when it comes to programming for me as it saves me time to modify an instance rather than having to 
        program everything by scratch.
      </li>
      <li>
        Singleton Method: This method is more of a theorem in programming that emphasizes that all instances are unique. A very basic but important design pattern especially when it comes to larger projects since issues could just arise due to instances with the same name.
      </li>
    </ul>

  ## Conclusion

  The best way to define design patterns in my words is that design patterns are the common solutions we form when it comes to an issue. The best way to fix an issue is as named to find a pattern in that issue, and by that pattern we find a solution. 
  By practicing utilizing desing patterns, a programmer will not only save lots of time, but also their effort.
