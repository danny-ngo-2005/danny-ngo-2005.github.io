## A Pattern
A common issue always occurs for many programmers as they tinker with coding. Every problem generally has a solution, and while many programmers may have trouble fixing such errors, others have probably already found the solution to the problem. The usage of design patterns has been a critical benefit in programming, as it allows programmers to solve different issues using common reusable solutions. The way to think of design patterns is like a toolbox. Each individual design pattern resembles an individual tool to utilize, and every problem can resemble what the tools are used for.

As opposed to programming based solely on wits, a design pattern has its benefits for the programmer. Especially when it comes to projects and large teams, it is often recommended to write your program in a format similar to a design pattern, as it allows others to see common issues and reuse components of design patterns.

## Design Patterns?
There are a wide variety of design patterns to consider. However, most of these design patterns for a programmer were probably used unintentionally. By giving more time to recognize these design patterns, a programmer can also reinforce their understanding of them. I would like to list some design patterns that I found to be effective in my programming skills:
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Prototype Method:</strong> This method involves a cut-and-paste approach which involves creating new instances from another pre-existing instance. This is an optimal choice when it comes to programming for me, as it saves me time to modify an instance rather than having to program everything from scratch.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Singleton Method:</strong> This method is more of a theorem in programming that emphasizes that all instances are unique. A very basic but important design pattern, especially when it comes to larger projects, since issues could arise due to instances with the same name.
  </li>
</ul>

## Conclusion
The best way to define design patterns in my words is that design patterns are the common solutions we form when it comes to an issue. The best way to fix an issue is, as named, to find a pattern in that issueâ€”and by that pattern, we find a solution. By practicing and utilizing design patterns, a programmer will not only save lots of time but also their effort.
