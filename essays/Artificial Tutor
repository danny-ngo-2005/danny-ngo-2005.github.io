## A Force of Evil to Some
Artificial intelligience has always gone through a growing development. Such so that in just a couple years, pictures, videos, and even audio were fabricated through the technicalities of artificial intelligence. Though A.I itself is a puzzling wonder that marks the beginning
of a new developing research, a concern lies among much of the community about its ethical use. Because of these features, issues arises such as how it could be use for illegal intent, or how debates arises among work done with heartful intent behind it versus someone creating
work in just a few words.

## A Boon to the World
Yet, A.I. has shown to give much benefit, especially to those who are going through their educational phase in their lifetime. Because of the popularity of A.I., students are able to utilize this tool to aid them in studying. Not only can it be used as a tool to aid in education,
but it also has a capacity to aid in normal-day situations. A person's dilemna can be solved through just an input from their keyboards. Complicated topics can be turned into simple topics for the student to understand. Of course, relying on A.I. fully won't give the most efficient
results to a student's learning, but when handled appropriately can allow them to understand a topic without having to take too much time and effort.

## A Personal Buddy
In the world of programming, A.I. is used almost everywhere. Especially when it comes to small errors that occur in the program, an A.I. can be able to check through the program to ensure that fixes are met. Especially when it came to my time programming, A.I. has been a big help in
allowing me to fix small issues in the program that would otherwise take me 10 minutes. Though, to rely on A.I. would be too big of an issue for me, as I feel that nothing is to be learnt of if I gave the A.I. the work to program everything. Rather, it was better for me to integrate
the concepts of programming into my code and let A.I. handle any syntax errors. Though I limit myself a lot on the use of A.I. and speak about its issues in a global scale, I can't help but appreciate having an artificial buddy to help me out with my time coding.
