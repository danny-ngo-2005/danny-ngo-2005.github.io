*“My words itch at your ears till you understand them”* - Walt Whitman

Learning new language is always intriguing, especially for me. Every language has their own "twist" in them that makes them stand out with other languages. For example, the Hawaiian language has a different way of structuring sentence, with the action coming first in the sentence before the noun. "E ho'okani au
i ka piano," can be roughly translated in English as, "Playing me the piano". Such twists and turns in the aspects of language make it a challenge for me to understand. 

However, as I learn to understand English, I must do the same with Hawaiian. I must understand the "root" of the language before branching out
into more complex areas. By time, I come to realize that most languages inherit similarities with each other. 

## Language? Language!

As English is to Hawaiian is Java to Typescript. There was a lot of struggle when it comes to learning Typescript for me, because I was very used to the format that Java has. I would have syntax errors one way or the other, since I would forget that I would be typing in another language. Many times I had
kept typing with assistance from other websites. What I failed to realize was that it was crucial for me to go back to the beginning, the foundation of Typescript. The best way for me to learn Typescript was to treat it the same way I did with Java: starting with "Hello World". Then once I learnt that, I
then move on to the next step.

Soon, I started to observe the similarities. Objects, arrays, loops, astract, interfaces... Each lesson I learn in Typescript was a memory I remembered regarding Java. 

## Typescript?

But a question dawned on me: What makes Typescript so unique? Why wouldn't every program just run with one programming language? Just as with verbal language, programming languages have their advantages and disadvantages. Java may be a universal language, but it does take a lot of effort just to print
"Hello world".

```java
  public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("Hello World");
          }
    }
```

But in Typescript, a single line of code is capable of producing the same output as Java would:

```ts
  console.log("Hello World");
```

While every language has an unanticipated disadvantage, there is also an area in which the language performs at their highest efficiency.

## Typescript!

Typescript, just like C and C++, is a unique language that I had to learn. It was not just a checkbox that I had to tick off, but rather an opportunity for me to experiment. A reason to learning a language like Hawaiian is to be able to be more open with people and being able to connect with other people
by breaking the language barrier. Such goes with programming languages, as I knew that by learning Typescript, I am also giving myself a skill that allows me to work with other employers and peers who are used to using Typescript.
