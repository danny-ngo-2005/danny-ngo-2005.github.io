## Professors always say...
There is no such thing as a stupid question. Many students have heard a similar quote like this. Yet throughout most of the class, not many hands were held high up. Especially for me, since I would restrained myself from asking the countless thought bubbles forming in my head. I had always feared what the opinions of my classmates and even the teacher who pronounce that quote would think. It was hard for me to define what it meant by a "stupid question". What makes a question stupid? Is it stupid even if the student does not observe it as so?

## What is a "Stupid Question"?

The best way to define a "stupid question" is what I believe to be a question that leads to more questions. If the person who asks the question gets worse off by the answer, then they are asking "stupid questions". Furthermore, a question not fully developed or rather comes up on the spot with no thought or effort put into it can also be considered a "stupid question". If a person doesn't even try to find the answer by themselves, but rather through the effort of someone else, is the answer even worth the effort? A good example of a stupid question is: 



## What is a "Smart Question"?

But even so, everything has uncertainties. Everyone has a question they want to find the answer to, and most of those questions have been answered from students to experts. Before even developing a smart question, researching or finding the answer should be the first thing you do. Chances are, someonme has asked the same question that you did. One addition to forming a smart question is to ensure that the question you are asking is with effort, and that the purpose you are trying to get from asking said question is to learn from it, not get a quick fix to a problem. 

## Asking for a hand

Being a software engineers, Issues always arises in programming. Sometimes, the syntax could be the answer to the error: forgetting to put semicolons, initializating variables, or forgetting to end a loop with a curly bracket. However, most of the issues from programming comes from having to dabble with different topic or even misunderstanding the topic as a whole. Asking questions should be the way for us to learn more of the content. However, with many experts on the field of software engineers, it can be intimidating to asks someone with a grand knowledge of programming. Thus, asking questions in the format and intent to learn will provide you much faster answers from your internet peers! As for me, I still will have to refine my questions. While I am not the best at asking a "smart question", I will at least put the effort into obtaining that answer, even if the person who answers it may think superficially of me. After all, we ask questions to understand; there is no such thing as a stupid question.
